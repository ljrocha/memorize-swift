For example, you might use switch age to evaluate the age variable, then have cases for 0 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 30, and so on. Switch blocks must be exhaustive in Swift, which means they must have cases to cover all possible values."

        "description": "The name for when the Swift compiler generates code on your behalf. For example, if you say that a custom struct conforms to Equatable, and all its properties already conform to Equatable, then Swift can synthesize a == function for it."
